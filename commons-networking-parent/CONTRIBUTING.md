There are two primary ways to contribute:

## Using the issue tracker

Use the issue tracker to suggest feature requests, report bugs, and ask questions. This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well as others who are interested in this solution.

Use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Find a bug or a feature, mention in the issue that you will take on that effort, then follow the _Changing the codebase_ guidance below.


## Changing the codebase

Generally speaking, you should fork this repository, make changes in your own fork, and then submit a pull request. All new code should have associated unit tests (if applicable) that validate implemented features and the presence or lack of defects.

Additionally, the code should follow any stylistic and architectural guidelines prescribed by the project. In the absence of such guidelines, mimic the styles and patterns in the existing codebase.
